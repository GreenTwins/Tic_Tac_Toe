# Tic_Tac_Toe


Simple Tic-tac-toe game that goes through the command line.

When asked if another player will be joining: 

1.) By typing either 'y' or "Y" it will give you the opportunity to play a friend (currently only if they are in person)

2.) By typing either 'n' or "N" you will be playing the computer dubbed "Challenger". Currently there is only an easy mode setting for the computer, but as this gets
updated, a few more modes will be added to increase gameplay difficulty

Continue to check in for updates, and have fun
